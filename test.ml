(** TEST PLAN
    OUnit vs. Manual testing: We used OUnit tests mainly for the static
    modules of the game, such as Deck and Player. Manual testing by running 
    `make play` is used for dynamic components, such as State and Command.
    This is because playing the actual game of Blackjack involves many 
    different scenarios that a test suite may not be able to cover
    holistically. Hence, most of our testing of the functionality of the
    game was in manual testing of the game.

    The modules that are covered in the test suite include
    Deck (testing drawing cards, creating a deck, general characteristics
    of a card), Player (player characteristics and player win/lose status), 
    Command (parsing different commands), State (get functions).
    Our test cases are mainly glass box testing since we know the program
    structure and wrote the code ourselves. We also used our internal knowledge 
    of the code we wrote to guide the selection of the test data 
    and to improve the test design.

    The testing approach works for this system because this is mostly a
    dynamic game, where the player and AI make dynamic choices, thus
    manual testing is effective in this area. For more static components,
    we do use glass-box testing to help reveal any errors in the framework
    of our game implementation. *)

(** [cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2] compares two lists to see whether

    contain any duplicates.  Second, they must contain the same elements,
    though not necessarily in the same order. *)
