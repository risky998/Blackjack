   Here are some helper functions for your testing of set-like lists. 
 ********************************************************************)

(** [cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2] compares two lists to see whether
    they are equivalent set-like lists.  That means checking two things.
    First, they must both be {i set-like}, meaning that they do not
    contain any duplicates.  Second, they must contain the same elements,
    though not necessarily in the same order. *)
let cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2 =
  let uniq1 = List.sort_uniq compare lst1 in
  let uniq2 = List.sort_uniq compare lst2 in
  List.length lst1 = List.length uniq1
  &&
  List.length lst2 = List.length uniq2
  &&
  uniq1 = uniq2

(** [pp_string s] pretty-prints string [s]. *)
let pp_string s = "\"" ^ s ^ "\""

(** [pp_list pp_elt lst] pretty-prints list [lst], using [pp_elt]
    to pretty-print each element of [lst]. *)

        else loop (n+1) (acc ^ (pp_elt h1) ^ "; ") t'
    in loop 0 "" lst
  in "[" ^ pp_elts lst ^ "]"

   [pp_list] to get helpful output from OUnit. *)
